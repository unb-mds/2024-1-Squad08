    following along a tutorial from freecodecamp, since i dont have time to actually learn and master what I'll use.
    Finished setting up a basic env, it seems. Now comes postgres, but i have slept 2 hours last night. It is 
    killing me. My head hurts. Hopefully, I'll be alright and able to do it tomorrow. 
    Can't win it all. At the very least, can't win it all in a single sprint.
